/**
 * locationsRouter — UK location type-ahead for the search location field.
 *
 * A single read-only `protectedProcedure`:
 *   - suggest({ q, limit? }): bundled-index suggestions for what the operator is
 *     typing — counties, unitaries/districts, regions (country), postcode areas
 *     & districts, towns. Each suggestion carries the outcodes it resolves to,
 *     so the form can show the catchment a search would target before saving.
 *
 * NO SERVICE LAYER and NO DB: the index is in-memory (lib/geo/uk-locations.ts),
 * so this is a pure, deterministic, offline lookup — the resolver is what the
 * repository also uses to derive a search's outcodes from its saved location.
